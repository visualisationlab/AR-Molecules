# AR-Molecules
Augmented Reality (AR) application to study symmetries in molecules.

## About this software
AR-Molecules was developed by Rob Kunst in 2017 as part of his Bachelor's thesis in Informatics at the University of Amsterdam (UvA). His project was supervised by Dr. Robert Belleman from the UvA Visualisation Lab. Rob's thesis, Learning Molecular Symmetry in Augmented Reality, provides an in-depth explanation of his work and can be accessed [here]([url](http://visualisationlab.science.uva.nl/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Rob-Kunst-Learning-molecular-symmetry-in-augmented-reality.pdf)).

Please note that this project is archived as it was left in 2017 and may require some updates to build and run. The project is built using Unity (version 5.6.0f3) and Vuforia.

This repository also includes a build in the form of an APK file in the Builds directory. Although it dates back to 2017, it should still install on most Android devices. To use the application, you will need two markers (available in the Markers directory):
- The  *Brouwerij 't IJ* coaster serves as the primary marker, where the molecule will appear.
- The *La Chouffe* marker acts as a mirror to explore molecular mirror symmetries.

We welcome and appreciate pull requests if anyone updates or improves the software.
